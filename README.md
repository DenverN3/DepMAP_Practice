# DepMAP_Practice
This is code from a tutorial on how to use DepMap from genetic data in cancer to find selected genes for targeted cell lines.
The depmap package aims to provide a reproducible research framework to cancer dependency data described by Tsherniak, Aviad, et al. “Defining a cancer dependency map.” Cell 170.3 (2017): 564-576.. The data found in the depmap package has been formatted to facilitate the use of common R packages such as dplyr and ggplot2. We hope that this package will allow researchers to more easily mine, explore and visually illustrate dependency data taken from the Depmap cancer genomic dependency study.
